				<h2>What is Ulna?</h2>
				<p>Ulna is designed to dramatically optimize peopleâ€™s health and efficiency with well built software that helps them reach their true potential.</p>
				<h2>Connected Sources</h2>
				<p>Ulna tracks some basic stats like steps and weight, but it is mostly powered by the other services and devices you connect to it. The more services you connect, the more data we can have about you and the more useful your dashboard will be.</p>
				<h2>Apple Healthkit</h2>
				<p>From the iPhone app, we load various data-points from HealthKit during the initial install, and keep them synced occasionally throughout the day. When installing the app, you will be able to choose which data types you want to sync. The possible options include: steps, weight, date of birth, and body mass undex.</p>
				<h2>Who can see your content?</h2>
				<p>Your account is set to private and you are the only one who can see your profile.</p>
				<h2>Analysis & Aggregation</h2>
				<p>We primarily use the data synced to Ulna to show you a dashboard and build your profile with as many relevant details as possible.</p>
				<h2>Analytics Tools</h2>
				<p>We use some few 3rd party services for analytics and error tracking on the Ulna platform. They are extremely secure and used by most of the top internet companies. These services include Google Analytics & Mixpanel.</p>
				<h2>Contact Us</h2>
				<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to email us at hello@ulna.co</p>
